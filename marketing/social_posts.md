# ResuCraft - Social Media & Launch Content

## 1. LinkedIn Post
**Headline:** Stop paying for simple resumes. Meet ResuCraft.

**Body:**
Job hunting is stressful enough without having to fight with formatting or pay monthly subscriptions just to download a PDF of your own work.

That’s why I built ResuCraft.

🚀 **ResuCraft is a Free, Privacy-First Resume Builder.**

✅ **Real-Time Preview**: Type on the left, see the result on the right.
✅ **ATS Friendly**: Clean, standard "Harvard" layout that recruiters love.
✅ **No Login Required**: Your data stays in your browser.
✅ **No Watermarks**: Professional PDF export for free.

I built this because I believe every job seeker deserves professional tools without barriers.

## 2. Twitter / X Thread

**Tweet 1:**
I got tired of resume builders that ask for your credit card *after* you spend an hour entering your data. 😤
So I built my own.
Introducing ResuCraft: The free, client-side resume builder. ↓

## 3. Product Hunt Launch (Maker's Comment)
**Tagline:** The privacy-first, real-time resume builder.

**Maker Comment:**
Hi Hunters! 👋

I'm excited to share ResuCraft with you today.

The inspiration came from a simple frustration: trying to help a friend update their resume, we cycled through 3 different "free" tools that all hit us with a paywall at the download screen.

ResuCraft is my answer to that. It's a straightforward, WYSIWYG resume builder that focuses on two things:
1. **Privacy**: It runs entirely in your browser. I don't see your data, and I don't store it.
2. **Simplicity**: No drag-and-drop chaos. Just fill in the forms, and get a clean, ATS-optimized PDF (based on the popular Harvard template).

It's completely free to use. I built this to help the community and provide a stress-free tool for job seekers.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feature requests!

Happy building! 🛠️
